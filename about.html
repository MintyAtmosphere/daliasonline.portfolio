        <p>Hello! 🌊 I’m Dalia, I’m a designer from California. I enjoy being creative, programming 💻, and hanging out with my puppy, Moose 🐶.</p>
            
        <p>My design days begin in the age of MySpace— editing images and making MySpace Layouts. (I was interviewed by NPR because of it once!) </p>
        <p>In 2014, I began to work as a full time graphic designer for a company named Beverly Furniture. During this time, I went back to school to finish my degree in Communication Studies. In school, I focused on the interaction of humans and technology, and set my career aspirations in the tech world. I moved to the Bay Area in 2016, and completed a bootcamp to learn coding.
        </p>
            
        <p>Most recently, I have been working as a design consultant and have partnered up with small businesses and non-profits. In my free time, I like to make candles, and dabble in some photography. </p>
            
        <p>I'm a former Chapter Leader of Girl Develop It- San Jose, and I'm currently a board member of<a href="www.techqueria.org">Techqueria.org</a></p>
