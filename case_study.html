            <h1>Setup</h1>
            <p>Our task at Casa de Chocolates was to create a more modern, user-friendly site that integrated seamlessly with social media and that would attract more customers.

                    The current site wasn’t generating enough revenue. The client wanted to increase sales, and improve user experience. The site also had bugs and was difficult to update and edit content. It was being hosted on Wordpress using Woo Commerce, and the client mentioned not really finding the Wordpress platform helpful.</p>
