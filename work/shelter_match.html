            <h1>The following is a product design challenge I solved as interview practice.  </h1> 
            <h1>Prompt:</h1>
            <p>Millions of animals are currently in shelters and foster homes awaiting adoption. Design an experience that will help connect people looking for a new pet with the right companion for them. Help an adopter find a pet which matches their lifestyle, considering factors including breed, gender, age, temperament, and health status. Provide a high-level flow and supporting wire frames.</p>
            
            <h1>Step 1: Understand</h1>
            
            <p>The first step in solving this prompt is understanding the goal, what am I trying to make, and why am I trying to make it. I start with pen and paper, writing down all the questions and concepts that come to mind. 

            <p><b>The idea: </b>Build an experience that allows people to find pets in shelters that they might want to adopt. This experience will be used by shelter employees, foster parents, and people interested in adopting. Shelters and foster homes can list pets and receive requests from adopters.</p>
                
            <p>Adopters can search for pets in local shelters that have traits that would go well with their lives.</p>

            <p><b>Questions:</b></p>

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p><a href="https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics">According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year. Of those, approximately 3.3 million are dogs and 3.2 million are cats.</a></p>
