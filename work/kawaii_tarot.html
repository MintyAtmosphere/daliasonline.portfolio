            <h1>Kawaii Tarot is an app that allows people to have the Kawaii Tarot deck in their mobile device. Aside from readings, users are able to save questions, and write notes in the journal.</h1>
            <p>When I began working on Kawaii Tarot, the problem we were facing was that a lot of people were downloading the app but they were never using it. After doing user research in the form of 1:1 user interviews I found that many people didn't "get" how the app worked.</p>
            <p>The first thing I proposed we make was a First Time User Experience so that first time users would get a walkthrough of the features the app has, and also a bit of insight into how Kawaii Tarot works.</p>
            <p>I also suggested visual changes so the features would be more prominent instead of being hidden in a hamburger menu.</p>
